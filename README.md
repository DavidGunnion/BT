# BT
This was a group university project.

My team was given the task to create a distributed file sharing program inspired by BitTorent which we called ByteTorrent. The program enables a swarm of users to share a file over the internet. Clients initially connect to a server (tracker) to find out about other clients and then they share files using peer-to-peer communication.

My responsibilities included:
* Design of the peer-to-peer communications protocol
* Programming the peer-to-peer client
* Contributing to the report

I have included source code and exeucatble for the client but only the executable for the tracker as I didn't write it. There are few code comments but the included [report](https://github.com/DavidGunnion/BT/blob/master/BT%20Spec%20and%20Documentation.pdf) expains how it functions in some detail.
